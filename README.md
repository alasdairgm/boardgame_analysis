# boardgame_analysis

Here is a little project I've been working on to log all of the boardgames I own and combine the data I have on them (such as prices and my own ratings) with the data from boardgamegeek.com.

I start off cleaning up and exploring the data before carrying out some analysis on the game data and building a linear regression model to explain the ratings I give games.
